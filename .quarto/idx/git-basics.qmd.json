The folder can “live” on your\n  local computer or a server like GitHub’s. On GitHub the repository is\n  also the web page where all the files are stored among other things\n- Push: Copy changes from your local version of the repo to the GitHub\n  version\n- Pull: Copy changes from the GitHub version of the repo to you local\n  version\n- Clone: make a copy of a git repository. By default in R studio this is\n  connected to the GitHub version (called the remote or origin)\n- Commit: A marker that is kept in the git history and helps to\n  incrementally track changes. Made useful by descriptive commit\n  messages\n\n\n\n## When to commit\n\n- Often!\n- But not too often!\n  - Use “Amend previous commit” checkbox when you want to make sure to\n    commit but aren’t sure you are done yet\n- Try to make each commit distinct and accomplish one thing. eg:\n  - `Make data cleaning script`\n  - `Create exploratory plots`\n  - `Fix bug in data cleaning handling of dates`\n  - `Update exploratory plots with dates`\n\n\n\n## What to commit\n\n- Everything!\n  - Git can track any file but it does a better job with raw text files\n    (eg: .R, .Rmd, .html, .md, .py, .sh, .txt)\n  - For files like word docs or pdfs it can’t track the content and\n    tracks the whole file every time you make a change\n- Except!:\n  - Nothing sensitive ie passwords, keys etc (you can have a private\n    repo if you are not ready to share code with the world but still don't store passwords)\n  - Probably not large datasets. I just keep these locally but would be\n    better to have them on a shared drive and download them\n    programmatically\n- .gitignore: a file at the top level of git repo that tells git what\n  not to track.\n  - Uses regular expressions to match file or folder names or types.\n  - Example file:\n    <https://github.com/LandSciTech/caribouMetrics/blob/master/.gitignore>\n\n## When to push\n- Fairly often. If you are working alone pushing is a way to back up\n  your files. If you are collaborating it is a way to make your work\n  available to others. If you don’t push and then a collaborator makes\n  changes to the same file it gets a bit tricky (but fixable).\n- Once you push you can’t use the “Amend previous commit” trick\n- If you find yourself reluctant to push because you aren’t ready for\n  others to use your work consider making a branch (see below)\n\n\n## When to pull\n\n- Ideally every day, or when a collaborator lets you know they pushed\n- Pulling often prevents getting out of sync with collaborators\n- Before pulling be sure to commit all your local work\n- Good practice to pull before pushing but git will normally warn you if you forget.\n\n\n\n## Merge conflicts in Push/Pull\n\n- If a collaborator pushed their changes after you last pulled you will\n  need to pull before you can push. If your changes don’t conflict git\n  will automatically merge their changes with yours.\n- Merge conflicts: when a collaborator made changes that overlap your\n  changes. Git can’t automatically fit them together you have to review\n  and pick the part to keep.\n\n\n\n## Resolving merge conflicts\n\nAh! I pulled at the start of the day but then a collaborator pushed a\nchange to the same line and now when I try to push it says I have to\npull first.  \n\n![](assets/img/push_fail.PNG)\n\nAnd then when I pull I get merge conflicts!\n\nNot too hard to fix. Go through each file that has the orange U in the\nGit pane. Find the location of the conflict. HEAD is your local version\nand the alphanumeric string is the commit id for the remote version that\nconflicts. Pick the one you want and delete all the marker lines\n(\\<\\<\\<, === and \\>\\>\\>). Then commit and continue on with your work\n![](assets/img/merge_conflict.png)\n\n\n\n## Avoiding merge conflicts\n\n- Pull regularly\n- Keep in touch with collaborators so you are not working on the same\n  lines at the same time.\n- Use a branch\n\n\n\n## Branches\n\n- A stream of commits that diverges from the main stream until it is\n  ready to re-join.\n- Helpful for starting a new version of something while making sure\n  others can keep using the old version’\n- Example we want to convert some functions used in a paper to become an\n  R package but Josie is working on writing the paper and needs the old\n  version to keep working. I make a branch where I re-arrange everything\n  into a package. If Josie makes changes to the main branch that affect\n  the functions I can see those and merge them into my branch.\n- See <https://happygitwithr.com/git-branches.html##git-branches> for how\n  to manage branches with the command line but it can also be done\n  through the Rstudio IDE and GitHub for the most part.\n\n\n\n## Tour of GitHub repository page\n\n- Code\n- Issues\n- Wiki\n- Settings\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"git-basics.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.475","bibliography":["references.bib"],"editor":"visual","theme":"cosmo"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}},"pdf":{"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"xelatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","output-file":"git-basics.pdf"},"language":{},"metadata":{"block-headings":true,"bibliography":["references.bib"],"editor":"visual","documentclass":"scrreprt"},"extensions":{"book":{}}}}}

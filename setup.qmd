# Installation and Setup

## Installation

- Install R and Rstudio (available from ECCC Software Centre)
  - Software Centre can be very slow to install, you can install R and
    RStudio without administrator permissions from the internet as well
    <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>
- Install Git <https://gitforwindows.org/> (does not require admin
  permissions)
  - NOTE: When asked about “Adjusting your PATH environment”, make sure
    to select “Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party
    software”. Otherwise, accept the defaults.
- Create a GitHub account <https://github.com/>

- Install R packages: Open RStudio and run in the console:
  - `install.packages("usethis")`


## Set username and email for git

- `usethis::use_git_config(user.name = "Jane Doe", user.email = "jane@example.org")`
  - `user.name` is the name associated with your git commits so just
    make it informative for your collaborators (ie: actual name, github
    username)
  - `user.email` must match your GitHub account email


## Let git talk to GitHub

- `usethis::create_github_token()`
  - Opens GitHub webpage: select “repo”, “user”, and “workflow” scopes
- `gitcreds::gitcreds_set()`



## Start a new project with GitHub

**Step 1**: Make a new repo on GitHub + Go to <https://github.com> and
make sure you are logged in. 

+ Near “Repositories”, click the big green “New” button.
  - How to fill this in:
    - Repository template: No template.
    - Repository name: myrepo . Like a variable name, in code:
      descriptive but brief, no whitespace. Letters, digits, - , . , or
      \_ are allowed.
    - Description: any short description of the project
    - Public.
    - Initialize this repository with: Add a README file.
    - Click the big green button that says “Create repository”.

**Step 2**: Copy repo URL + Now click the big green button that says
“\<\> Code”. 

+ Copy a clone URL to your clipboard. Use the HTTPS URL.

**Step 3**: Clone into a new project in RStudio

- File \> New Project \> Version Control \> Git. In the “repository URL”
  paste the URL of your new GitHub repository.
  - Be intentional about where you create this Project. Don't put it inside another git repository.
  - I suggest you “Open in new session”.
- Click “Create Project” to create a new directory,
- This should download the README.md file that we created on GitHub in
  the previous step. Look in RStudio’s file browser pane for the
  README.md file.
- Behind the scenes, RStudio has done this for you:
  `git clone https://github.com/see24/myrepo.git`



## Work on a project
+ Edit the README.md file, e.g., by adding the line “This is a line from RStudio”. 
+ Save the file locally 
+ On the Git pane click commit 

![](assets/img/git_pane.png)

+ In the pop-up review the changes at the bottom 
+ Check the “Staged” box and type a commit message and click “Commit”

## Sync changes to GitHub: Push

 + Click “Push” in the Rstudio Git pane
 + Look at the repo on GitHub so see the new line is there
 
![](assets/img/push.png)



## Sync local copy from GitHub: Pull

+ In the GitHub repo main page  
+ In the upper right corner of the Readme, click on the pencil 
+ Add a line eg : “Line added from GitHub.” 
+ Click “Commit changes.”
+ In RStudio click Pull on the Git pane 
+ You should see the new line in the Readme

## Add an existing project to GitHub

- Create a new repo and Rstudio project in the same way as above
- Simply copy all files into the newly created folder on your local
  computer
- Stage and commit all files that you **want to store on GitHub**
  - Nothing sensitive ie passwords, keys etc (you can have a private
    repo if you are not ready to share code with the world)
  - Probably not large datasets
  - Use . gitignore to avoid git tracking things (more on this later)

*This is the simplest way to do it but there are more advanced, more
traditional git ways to do it:

## Issues with installation

If RStudio is not finding a git installation: + Restart RStudio and try
again + If still not working, run this in the windows command line:
`git --exec-path` + Copy the path, then in RStudio click Tools \> Global
Options \> Git/SVN and set the Git executable by clicking browse,
pasting the path in the address bar and selecting the git.exe file. +
Restart RStudio again

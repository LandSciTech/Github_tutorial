# Intermediate Git

## Time travel

One of the key benefits of using version control is the ability to go backwards and see what a project looked like at a previous time point.

Key commands: 

- `git checkout HEAD^`: go to previous commit 
- `git checkout HEAD~3`: go back three commits 
- `git checkout 4959f4d`: go to the commit with the id "4959f4d" 
- `git checkout master`: go to the most recent commit on the master (or insert other name) branch.

Explain "detached HEAD" and what reset does...
